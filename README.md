## The Product

### Overview

The Lecture-Student Platform is a specialized messaging system designed to bridge the communication gap between educators and students. It provides a structured, real-time messaging environment where academic discussions can take place in both one-on-one and group settings.

Unlike general-purpose chat applications, this platform is tailored specifically for educational contexts, with features that support academic workflows and maintain appropriate professional boundaries between lecturers and students.

### Key Features

- **Role-Based Access**: Separate lecturer and student accounts with appropriate permissions
- **Real-Time Messaging**: Instant message delivery with typing indicators and read receipts
- **Group Chats**: Support for course-specific discussion groups
- **Chat History**: Searchable message archives
- **Message Export**: Export chat histories for record-keeping
- **Invitation System**: Share chat access via invite links
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across devices and screen sizes
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system
- **Message Search**: Find specific content in conversations

## The Technology

### Architecture

The Lecture-Student Platform follows a modern client-server architecture:

- **Frontend**: A responsive Next.js application that provides the user interface
- **Backend**: A Node.js/Express API server handling business logic
- **Database**: MongoDB for data persistence
- **Real-time Communication**: Socket.IO for instant messaging functionality
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user sessions

### Tech Stack

#### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3 (React 19)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **State Management**: React Context API and custom hooks
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO client
- **HTTP Client**: Axios
- **Date Handling**: date-fns

#### Backend

- **Runtime**: Bun (JavaScript/TypeScript runtime)
- **Framework**: Express 5
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- **Authentication**: JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- **Password Security**: bcrypt
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO server
- **Environment**: dotenv for configuration

#### DevOps

- **Containerization**: Docker with docker-compose
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Package Management**: Bun for server, npm for client

### Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

```
lecture-student-platform/
├── client/                 # Frontend Next.js application
│   ├── app/                # Next.js app directory

```

### Installation

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ or Bun 1.2+
- MongoDB 6+
- Docker and docker-compose (optional, for containerized deployment)

#### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lecture-student-platform.git
   cd lecture-student-platform
   ```

2. Install server dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd server
   bun install
   ```

3. Install client dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the server directory:

   ```
   PORT=5000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/lecture-student-platform
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
   ```

   Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/
   ```

### Development

#### Running the Backend

```bash
cd server
bun run index.ts
```

#### Running the Frontend

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at:

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:5000

### Deployment

#### Using Docker

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start both the client and server applications, along with a MongoDB instance.

#### Manual Deployment

- Backend: Deploy to any Node.js-compatible hosting
- Frontend: Build with `npm run build` in the client directory and deploy the resulting output
- Database: Set up a MongoDB instance (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
